  DS1844.h - Library for controlling a Maxim Integrated DS1844 Quad Digital Potentiometer
  Created by Matt Westwick; March 23, 2013
  Released into the public domain.
  
  This example demonstrates how to use the Maxim DS1844 and the DS1844 library
  to fade 4 LEDs. The setup is as follows:
  
  DS1844 pins 1, 2, 3, 18, 19, and 20 connect to Arduino +5v
  DS1844 pins 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16 connect to Arduino GND
  DS1844 pin 4 -> [+LED1-] -> [100ohm Resistor] -> [Arduino GND]
  DS1844 pin 7 -> [+LED2-] -> [100ohm Resistor] -> [Arduino GND]
  DS1844 pin 14 -> [+LED3-] -> [100ohm Resistor] -> [Arduino GND]
  DS1844 pin 17 -> [+LED4-] -> [100ohm Resistor] -> [Arduino GND]
  DS1844 pin 12 -> Arduino SDA (on UNO this is Analog4)
  DS1844 pin 13 -> Arduino SCL (on UNO this is Analog5)
